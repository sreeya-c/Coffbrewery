# Coffbrewery
Technology:HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Angular JS


Coffbrewery is a project which is based on an idea that serves customers coffee orders. 
It displays a list of types of coffee available and the products which a customer can choose for the quantity. 
In addition, there's also a feature “add to cart” in which a customer can review his pending orders and make a direct order through it,
also a particular order can be deleted at any time as per wish.
So, for each functionality we made an html page along with CSS using bootstrap and angular js . 
Further, we can use database to store all the orders and retrieve as and when required.
